Version 0.8: 2008-11-26

        - reorganized functions into three groups:

          * Runuran-Distribution:
            easy-to-use sampling algorithms for particular
            distributions.

	  * Runuran-Universal:
	    interface to a carefully selected collection of UNU.RAN
	    methods with their most important variants.

	  * Runuran-Advanced:
            wrapper to the UNU.RAN string API.

        - improved documentation,
          added vignette

	- new function uq() for computing quantiles apprimately.

        - new functions for directly creating generator objects 
          for selected UNU.RAN methods:
    	    ars.new()
	    dari.new()
	    dau.new()
	    dgt.new()
	    hitro.new()
	    itdr.new()
	    pinv.new()
	    srou.new()
	    tdr.new()
	    vnrou.new()

        - new functions for creating UNU.RAN distribution 
          objects: 

  	    unuran.cmv.new(...)    replaces  unuran.cmv()
	    unuran.cont.new(...)   replaces  unuran.cont()
	    unuran.discr.new(...)  replaces  unuran.discr()

          Remark: The default for argument 'islog' has been changed to 
          'islog=FALSE'.

	- deprecated functions:
	     uqhinv()
             urdau()
	     urdgt()	
	     urhitro()
	     urtdr()

        - contains UNU.RAN version 1.3.0


Version 0.7: 2008-04-21

	- print() now shows some information about a generator
          object.

	- new function unuran.details() for printing detailed 
	  information about a generator object.

	- new function uqhinv() for compting quantiles approximately
	  using UNU.RAN method 'HINV'.


Version 0.6: 2007-12-10

        - added slots for a rectangular domain and the center 
          (point in main region of distribution) for multivariate 
          distribution class 'distr.cmv'.

        - new method 'MVTDR' in UNU.RAN.

        - fixed broken optional arguments in routines urtdr() and
          urhitro().

            (The optional arguments were not passed to the given
            density function in contradiction to the help page of
	    these routines.)


Version 0.5: 2007-08-01

	- added S4 classes for distribution objects:

	    This allows to define distributions by means of
	    R functions instead of using the UNU.RAN string API
	    (which is still supported).

	- added support for multivariate distributions.

	- added routine 'urtdr'.


Version 0.4: 2007-05-16

        - First public release.
