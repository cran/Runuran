Version 0.7.1: 2008-06-04

	- fixed a problem with garbage collector


Version 0.7: 2008-04-21

	- print() now shows some information about a generator
          object

	- new function unuran.details() for printing detailed 
	  information about a generator object 

	- new function uqhinv() for compting quantiles approximately
	  using UNU.RAN method HINV


Version 0.6: 2007-12-10

        - added slots for a rectangular domain and the center 
          (point in main region of distribution) for multivariate 
          distribution class 'distr.cmv'

        - new method MVTDR in UNU.RAN

        - fixed broken optional arguments in routines urtdr() and urhitro()
            (The optional arguments were not passed to the given
            density function in contradiction to the help page of
	    these routines.)


Version 0.5: 2007-08-01

	- added S4 classes for distribution objects:

	    This allows to define distributions by means of
	    R functions instead of using the UNU.RAN string API
	    (which is still supported)

	- added support for multivariate distributions

	- added routine 'urtdr'


Version 0.4: 2007-05-16

        - First public release
