Version 0.6: 2007-12-10

        - added slot for a rectangular domain and the center 
          (point in main region of distribution) for multivariate 
          distribution class 'distr.cmv'

        - new method MVTDR in UNU.RAN

        - fixed broken optional arguments in routines urtdr() and urhitr()
            (The optional arguments were not passed to the given
            density function in contradiction to the help page of
	    these routines.)


Version 0.5: 2007-08-01

	- added S4 classes for distribution objects:

	    This allows to define distributions by means of
	    R functions instead of using the UNU.RAN string API
	    (which is still supported)

	- added support for multivariate distributions

	- added routine 'urtdr'


Version 0.4: 2007-05-16
