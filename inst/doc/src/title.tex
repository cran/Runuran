\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
  \Runuran\ is a wrapper to UNU.RAN (\emph{Universal
    Non-Uniform RANdom variate generators}), a library for generating
  random variates for large classes of distributions. It also allows
  to compute quantiles (inverse cumulative distribution 
  functions) of these distributions efficiently. 
  In order to use UNU.RAN one must supply some data like the denstiy 
  about the target distribution which are then used to draw random samples.
  \Runuran\ functions provide both a simplified interface to this
  library for common distributions as well access to the full power of
  this library.
